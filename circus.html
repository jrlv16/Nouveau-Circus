Loyal who was known as the best tamer of the 19th century. He made a show with such different animals as tigers, lions, zebra and chimpanzees at the same time on stage. This show traveled accross Europe for years, but stopped due to the first world war. In 1921 his children decided to restore his former show, but they didn't have the talent of their father who was too old to do it again. That's why they change the show in a new one, more spectacular but not so dangerous</p>
